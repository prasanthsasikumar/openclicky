# HeyClicky Dev Setup Doctor

Help non-expert builders understand and repair their local development environment. Prefer diagnosis before changes, and explain the failure in plain language.

## Use When
- The user asks why Codex, Claude Code, MCP, terminal commands, localhost, packages, API keys, or dev servers are broken.
- The task mentions npm, node, pnpm, Python, Supabase, Cloudflare, Wrangler, `.env`, MCP servers, or auth setup.
- The user asks what to run next.

## Do Not Use When
- The user asks for normal repo feature work, PRs, commits, or CI review; use `clicky-repo-operator`.
- The user asks to build and visually preview a site/app; use `clicky-build-preview`, then return here only for setup blockers.
- The user asks to connect an external app account; only diagnose local auth/config if a real connection runtime is exposed, otherwise report that the connection surface is not shipped in this build.

## Primary Path
1. Identify the project folder and active toolchain.
2. Check status before changing anything: versions, env files, running processes, ports, auth status, and logs.
3. Explain the failure in plain language.
4. Apply the smallest safe fix or provide the exact next command.

## Fallbacks
- If permissions/auth are missing, state the exact missing permission or login and the next setup action.
- If a local server is not running, start it only when the user asked for a working preview or task execution.
- Use app-specific setup skills, such as HeyClicky's local-dev skill, when they apply.

## Safety
- Do not overwrite `.env` files or secrets.
- Do not touch production services unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not run destructive package or database resets without confirmation.

## Artifacts
- When setup creates logs, config files, or reports, provide exact paths.
- When fixing localhost, provide the final URL and process command.

## Verification
- Re-run the failing command, health check, or version check.
- For web servers, verify the port responds.
- For MCP/agent setup, verify tool discovery or connection status.
